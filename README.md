# Hi

My name is Christopher Mitchell. I'm a beginning developer, learning to code at Codeworks, in Boise, ID. I\My background is mostly in restaurant ownership and consultation, but I also really enjoy indie tabletop roleplaying games and have many ideas for incorperating my love for technology and my love for story-telling games into areas that are currently unserved. Also, while I like talking about ideas, I'm wildly uncomfortable talking about myself. If you have reached the end of this paragraph, I'm sure that's very apparent.

Currently reading: Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, again.
Currently playing: Ars Magicka
Currently uncomfortable with: this profile
