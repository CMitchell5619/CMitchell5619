# Hi

My name is Christopher Mitchell. I'm a software developer and recent graduate of Codeworks, in Boise, ID. My background is mostly in restaurant ownership, equity/real estate investment and business consultation, but I also really enjoy indie tabletop roleplaying games and have many ideas for incorporating my love for technology and my love for story-telling games into areas that are currently underserved.

**Currently reading:** Clean Code  
**Currently playing:** Burning Wheel
